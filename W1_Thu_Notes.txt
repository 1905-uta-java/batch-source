Exceptions
	NullPointerException
		Try to access part of a null object
	ArrayOutOfBoundsException
		Try to access element outside of array bounds
	
	Error
		Cannot be recovered from
		Rare, but often caused by out-of-code problems
	Exception
		Can be recovered from with the right implementation
		Runtime Exception
			Easily avoided
		Checked Exception
			May not be avoidable
			Must be checked for if throwable code is reached.
	
	Recoverable:
		Throws... clause to check for if an exception is thrown.
		or
		Wrap code in try {} catch(exception) {} [finally {}]
		
	Can create your own exception to test for problems specific to your code
	Try/Catch
		Can have multiple "catch" blocks to catch different exceptions/exception types
			Careful with unreachable code
		Can have "finally" block to clean up resources whether or not an exception occured
		If your code doesn't catch the exception that occured, the try/catch block will fail to continue

	We will not be using these ourselves very often

	Parse inputs
	has... 
		Checks to see if we have a type of input to read
