HTTP methods
	GET - return resource from site 
	POST - give new information to site
	PUT - update information on site
	DELETE - remove information from site
	TRACE - debugging, recieves information sent
	OPTIONS - returns what other methods you can use
	HEAD - returns head metadata and not body information
	What the website does with these is up to it, but most common practice
Servlets and Client-Server communication
	JS AJAX --XmlHttpRequest-> Tomcat Server --Creates-> Servlet 
	Client <-HttpResponse-- Server
	Deployment descriptor (webXML)
		Determines what http request creates which servlet
	WebXML
		<web-app> (ROOT)
			(Extra parameters)
			<servlet>
				<servlet-name> name1 </servlet-name>
				<servlet-class> com.().() </servlet-class>
				(Init parameters)
				(Load on startup tag)
			</servlet>
			<servlet-mapping>
				<servlet-name> name1 </servlet-name>
				<url-pattern> /name </url-pattern>
			</servlet-mapping>
		</web-app>
	Our servlets are classes that extend HTTPServlet
	Servlet service method invoked with ServletRequest/ServletResponse
	Another method determines what handler method should be invoked
		Handler methods are overloaded on our servlets
		protected void do[Method](HTTPServletRequest req, HTTPServletResponse rsp) throws IOException, ServletException {.}
			Method is Get, Post, Put...
	HTTPServletResponse
		Can redirect client (300 code with URL)
		Change response values (headers, body, etc.)
		Give response code (200 success, 300 redirect, 400 error)
		PrintWriter can write directly on HTTP body
	PrintWriter
		Jackson Databind - Convert between java objects and JSON/XML
		WriteValue - Object -> String
		ReadValue - String -> Object
	Forwarding
		Servlets can "forward" information to other servlets
		User doesn't notice, fully server-side and does not change URL
			A redirect would change URL, forwarding doesn't
		Response comes from servlet that was forwarded to
		Include - Gives response from both servlets instead of just second one
		AJAX calls don't change URL at all, invisiblle to user
