# BankAppJDBC  
 
Create a mock bank in which you communicate with your user via the console. Persist your data in an Oracle SQL database using JDBC.  
 Your application ​must​:   - use at least one Statement, PreparedStatement, and CallableStatement - Use the DAO design pattern - Use proper coding conventions  - Ensure that input is thoroughly validated - Use JUnit to test your service layer 
 
The following are the user stories that must be fulfilled for a minimal viable product (MVP). As a user on the system, I can: 
1. create a user account with a unique email and/or username      (must have multiple users) 
2. secure my account using a password 
3. log in/log out 
4. create a bank account associated with each user 
5. deposit money 
6. withdraw money (no negative balances!) 
7. view account balance 
 
Your bank can optionally support: - Use log4j to replace System.out.println with logging  - Multiple user bank accounts (checking & savings) - Transfer funds functionality between user accounts - Joint accounts (a single account with two separate users having access) - Ability to view transaction history - Password encryption for added security 
 
Good luck!
