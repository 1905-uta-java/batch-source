# Core Java Evaluation - Revature

## Description

Revature is building a new API! This API contains methods for validating data, 
solving problems, and encoding data. The API consists of 20 methods that you 
must implement:

* Without using the StringBuilder or StringBuffer class, write a method that reverses a String.
* Convert a phrase to its acronym.
* Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. 
* Given a word, compute the scrabble score for that word.
* Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.
* Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.
* Implement a binary search algorithm.
* An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
* Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher.
* Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.
* Create an implementation of the atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East. Encode a value with the cipher
* Create an implementation of the atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East. Decode a value with the cipher
* Write a method that validates a number to be proper ISBN-10.
* Determine if a sentence is a pangram.
* Calculate the moment when someone has lived for 10^9 seconds.
* Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.

## Requirements
* Git
* GitHub Account
* IDE/Text Editor

Your trainer will pass out a link for assignments, projects, and coding challenges. When clicked on for the first time, you will be asked to login with your GitHub credentials, choose your name from a class roster, and accept the assignment. You will also receive an email inviting you to the classroom organization as a future collaborator. Once you have accepted the assignment, a repository with the naming convention [assignment-name]-[your-user-name] will be created on the organization containing instructions and starter code.

Open a terminal shell or git-scm terminal and clone the repository to your computer using the Git command:
	
	git clone https://github.com/[OrganizationName]/[RepositoryName].git

Next, open the project with your preferred text editor or IDE and complete the assignment according to your trainer’s instructions or Readme. When you are ready to submit your assignment, add, commit, and push your changes using the git commands:

```
	git add .
	git commit -m “Assignment Completed”
	git push
```

Be sure not to alter the folder structure, configuration files, or unit tests of the assignment unless specifically told to do so by your trainer. Be aware of any deadlines set by the trainer, and push your code beforehand.
