        <p class="text-left text-primary">Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Look at them little rascals. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.</p>

        <p class="text-right text-success">Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Don't fiddle with it all day.</p>
        
        <p class="text-center text-info">A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. It takes dark in order to show light. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Use what you see, don't plan it. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.</p>
        
        <p class="text-nowrap text-warning">In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. With practice comes confidence.</p>
        
        <p class="text-danger">You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. A fan brush can be your best friend. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.</p>
        
        <p class="bg-primary">Those great big fluffy clouds. This piece of canvas is your world. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes?</p>
        
        <p class="bg-warning">Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.</p>

            <p class="col-lg-6">I'm a water fanatic. I love water. It's cold, but it's beautiful. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Here's something that's fun. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We'll put a happy little bush here. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.</p>
            <p class="col-lg-6">Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. We can fix anything. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Only eight colors that you need. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.</p>
