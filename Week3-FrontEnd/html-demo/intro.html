    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage!</h1>
    <hr>

    <p class="formatted-par">There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.</p>

    <p class="formatted-par">Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. And right there you got an almighty cloud. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. All kinds of happy little splashes. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.</p>

    <p class="formatted-par">Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.</p>

    <p>This piece of canvas is your world. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.</p>

    <p>I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. This is truly an almighty mountain. In your world you have total and absolute power.</p>

    <p>Let's make a happy little mountain now. Let's get crazy. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.</p>

    <p> <strong> You can do it. </strong> Remember how <em> free </em> clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.  <div> From all of us here, </div>  I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.</p>
