Front Controller Pattern
	One servlet handles all requests
	Based on requests, delegates to other servlets
	Use RequestHelpers to determine delegate to process request
Authorization
	Best practice: Client session holds authentication
	Steps:
		Send authentication request
		Wait for auth token response / fail state
		Keep given token in session storage
		Send token for all subsequent requests
	Can redirect anyone without a token to another page before it loads
