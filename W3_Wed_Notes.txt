Bootstrap
	CSS Framework
	Seperation of CSS for different resolution browsers (phones, iPads, pcs)
	Grid system
	Connects to closest Bootstrap server
	Look up documentation for details
JavaScript
	Runs in the browser
	Started as interpreted, but moved to JIT compilation
	UNLIKE JAVA - loosely typed
		Do not need to declare a variable's type.
		Can interpret a variable as a different type later
		No compile-time error checking
		Using a variable as something it isn't is dangerous
	Type coercion:
		implicit coercion
		JavaScript will attempt to change a variable's type to fit the context
		4+true=5
		while("bananas"); -> while(true);
		true:	Anything other than VVV
		false:	"", 0, undefined, null, NaN, false
		Strings take priority on a+b if either a or b are a string
		Strings will convert to a number if possible with other operators (*, -, /)
		If a string fails to convert, the result will become NaN
		7 == "7" : True ; 7 === "7" : False
	Primitive types:
		number		(Which includes NaN)
		boolean
		string
		undefined 	(Not yet delcared)
		null		(Explicitly set)
		symbol
		Others are objects
	var variable_name - declares variable in current scope (method minimum)
		Can "use" variable outside declaration scope, however it won't have a value.
	let variable_name... - declare variable in current scope, including block scope
		Cannot use variable outside declaration scope.
	; are optional, as they are autoplaced at the end of a line
		Can cause problems.
	Can use JavaScript inline in HTML with <script> ... </script>
		Generally put at the bottom of the <body>
